qian qichen said : " during my visit , i also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the us congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic chinese community , and community of chinese people residing in the united states . they all expressed the wish to see china and the united states friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
1.0461770366218344
during his visit to the united states , qian qichen also separately met with us vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , and national security adviser to the president condoleezza rice to exchange views with them on china 's accession to the world trade organization , the human rights issue , bilateral trade and the issue of the us establishment of the nmd . 
1.048537038220412
while denouncing iraq in strong terms , the us government is working on a new set of national security strategy . defense officials said that the united states will take preemptive military actions against states that support terrorism and seek to develop weapons of mass destruction . 
1.049510124790706
senate foreign relations committee chairman jesse helms said that the us policy is that taiwan is not a chinese province and that the united states only acknowledges that chinese people on both sides of the strait hold that there is only one china , while bolton said that the united states never subscribed to the view that the " china " in the " one china " policy refers to the prc . 
1.0498164533374938
this is of course related to the us domestic political situation , but it should be realized that for the united states nmd is not a purely security issue but also involves vast science and technology and economic interests ; at the same time it is also a strategic means by which the united states will continue to preserve its " world hegemony " status in the future , and so the united states will not lightly change course . 
1.0516483203461078
after that , in an interview by the us cable news network ( cnn ) , qian qichen personally made a clarification denying he had said that and emphasized : " what move china will make by that time depends on the situation . " he pointed out that china and the united states already reached consensus on us arms sales to taiwan in 1982 and he believed the united states is clear about china 's stand and will properly handle its arms sales to taiwan . 
1.0519991848189674
he also vigorously fawned on the united states by stressing that keeping the channels of contact open between the us and taiwan administrative departments " is in us interests in the asia-pacific region " ; he said that although the us side does not want to be a cross-strait mediator , it " can play a more active part as a stabilizer and balancer between the two sides " ; this was ingratiating himself with the us government and catering to the us strategic intention to " curb china by means of taiwan " . 
1.0560563941268106
however , we hope and believe that , during the term of president george w . bush , the united states ' china policy , supported by the two us parties , will continue to be implemented and that sino-us relations will see new development . 
1.0561226118548743
however , the arms sales meeting will still be of importance , because it will become an indicator for us to observe the orientation of the china policy pursued by the new government in the united states . 
1.056349072106755
he said : it was not the chinese plane that came to the united states , but the us aircraft flew to china . 
1.0579643445253748
since us president bush took office , he and his major government officials have repeatedly said that the tough diplomatic policy toward iraq that the united states has adopted over a long period of time will not be changed .

i believe that the pressure from unemployment is actually high . we must adopt all kinds of measures to reduce this kind of pressure . we should open up new channels for employment , train more laid-off workers , and help people change their concepts on employment and improve their skills for new jobs in order to properly solve the problem of unemployment . 
1.4620789275534687
this reporter has learned from the ministry of labor and social security that the current sustained growth of national economy can help create jobs ; however , as economic restructuring will be intensified , the number of workers laid off by state-owned enterprises is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 2001 . moreover , a noticeable increase in the numbers of new members of the work force and unemployed personnel directly seeking job in the labor market will bring considerable pressure on chinese cities and country in employment this year .

since the reform across the country is currently in the stage of solving the most difficult problems , the social problem of employment is still serious and the government is still faced with great difficulties and pressure in settling laid-off individuals . this especially requires the whole society , the whole military , the whole of the people and the whole party to strive , with one mind and one heart , to solve kernel problems .

for example , there are things such as afforestation work , controlling environmental pollution , and community service , etc . , where there are a great many job opportunities , so we should get the laid-off workers to alter their concept of employment and actively seek reemployment .
